# Midterm for Data Structures and Algorithms
FSD07 - Lucas Pham #6213193

## Notes
I edited the `PriorityStackTest` class a bit to remove some warnings I had with JUnit `5.10.0-M1`. I added three more tests for my `NoSuchElementException` handling methods. I did not change the expected output of any pre-existing test.

I also have a Main class where I did my initial testing with integers.

I'm providing screenshots of those test results.
